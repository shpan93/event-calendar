For example:\n *\n *                                            <Paper>\n *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n *                                            </Paper>\n *\n *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n *\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n */\n\nvar styles = {\n  box: {\n    boxSizing: 'border-box'\n  }\n};\n\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = function (_Component) {\n  _inherits(BeforeAfterWrapper, _Component);\n\n  function BeforeAfterWrapper() {\n    _classCallCheck(this, BeforeAfterWrapper);\n\n    return _possibleConstructorReturn(this, Object.getPrototypeOf(BeforeAfterWrapper).apply(this, arguments));\n  }\n\n  _createClass(BeforeAfterWrapper, [{\n    key: 'render',\n    value: function render() {\n      var _props = this.props;\n      var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n      var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n      var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n      var afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n      var elementType = _props.elementType;\n\n      var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\n      var prepareStyles = this.context.muiTheme.prepareStyles;\n\n\n      var beforeElement = void 0;\n      var afterElement = void 0;\n\n      if (beforeStyle) {\n        beforeElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, beforeStyle)),\n          key: '::before'\n        });\n      }\n\n      if (afterStyle) {\n        afterElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, afterStyle)),\n          key: '::after'\n        });\n      }\n\n      var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\n      var props = other;\n      props.style = prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, this.props.style));\n\n      return _react2.default.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n    }\n  }]);\n\n  return BeforeAfterWrapper;\n}(_react.Component);\n\nBeforeAfterWrapper.propTypes = {\n  afterElementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  afterStyle: _react.PropTypes.object,\n  beforeElementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  beforeStyle: _react.PropTypes.object,\n  children: _react.PropTypes.node,\n  elementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  /**\n   * Override the inline-styles of the root element.\n   */\n  style: _react.PropTypes.object\n};\nBeforeAfterWrapper.defaultProps = {\n  beforeElementType: 'div',\n  afterElementType: 'div',\n  elementType: 'div'\n};\nBeforeAfterWrapper.contextTypes = {\n  muiTheme: _react.PropTypes.object.isRequired\n};\nexports.default = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/material-ui/internal/BeforeAfterWrapper.js\n ** module id = 596\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\n\nvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\nvar _createClass = function () { function defineProperties(target, props) { for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) { var descriptor = props[i]; descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false; descriptor.configurable = true; if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true; Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor); } } return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) { if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps); if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps); return Constructor; }; }();\n\nvar _react = require('react');\n\nvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\nvar _reactDom = require('react-dom');\n\nvar _reactDom2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reactDom);\n\nvar _reactEventListener = require('react-event-listener');\n\nvar _reactEventListener2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reactEventListener);\n\nvar _RenderToLayer = require('../internal/RenderToLayer');\n\nvar _RenderToLayer2 = _interopRequireDefault(_RenderToLayer);\n\nvar _propTypes = require('../utils/propTypes');\n\nvar _propTypes2 = _interopRequireDefault(_propTypes);\n\nvar _Paper = require('../Paper');\n\nvar _Paper2 = _interopRequireDefault(_Paper);\n\nvar _throttle = require('lodash/throttle');\n\nvar _throttle2 = _interopRequireDefault(_throttle);\n\nvar _PopoverAnimationDefault = require('./PopoverAnimationDefault');\n\nvar _PopoverAnimationDefault2 = _interopRequireDefault(_PopoverAnimationDefault);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?

Caveats:\r\n *     - namespace prefixes aren't resolved in XPathEvaluator.createExpression,\r\n *       but in XPathExpression.evaluate.\r\n *     - XPathResult.invalidIteratorState is not implemented.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 17: October 25, 2005\r\n *   Some core XPath function fixes and a patch to avoid crashing certain\r\n *   versions of MSXML in PathExpr.prototype.getOwnerElement, thanks to\r\n *   S閎astien Cramatte <contact (at) zeninteractif.com>.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 16: September 22, 2005\r\n *   Workarounds for some IE 5.5 deficiencies.\r\n *   Fixed problem with prefix node tests on attribute nodes.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 15: May 21, 2005\r\n *   Fixed problem with QName node tests on elements with an xmlns=\"...\".\r\n *\r\n * Revision 14: May 19, 2005\r\n *   Fixed QName node tests on attribute node regression.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 13: May 3, 2005\r\n *   Node tests are case insensitive now if working in an HTML DOM.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 12: April 26, 2005\r\n *   Updated licence.  Slight code changes to enable use of Dean\r\n *   Edwards' script compression, http://dean.edwards.name/packer/ .\r\n *\r\n * Revision 11: April 23, 2005\r\n *   Fixed bug with 'and' and 'or' operators, fix thanks to\r\n *   Sandy McArthur <sandy (at) mcarthur.org>.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 10: April 15, 2005\r\n *   Added support for a virtual root node, supposedly helpful for\r\n *   implementing XForms.  Fixed problem with QName node tests and\r\n *   the parent axis.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 9: March 17, 2005\r\n *   Namespace resolver tweaked so using the document node as the context\r\n *   for namespace lookups is equivalent to using the document element.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 8: February 13, 2005\r\n *   Handle implicit declaration of 'xmlns' namespace prefix.\r\n *   Fixed bug when comparing nodesets.\r\n *   Instance data can now be associated with a FunctionResolver, and\r\n *     workaround for MSXML not supporting 'localName' and 'getElementById',\r\n *     thanks to Grant Gongaware.\r\n *   Fix a few problems when the context node is the root node.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 7: February 11, 2005\r\n *   Default namespace resolver fix from Grant Gongaware\r\n *   <grant (at) gongaware.com>.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 6: February 10, 2005\r\n *   Fixed bug in 'number' function.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 5: February 9, 2005\r\n *   Fixed bug where text nodes not getting converted to string values.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 4: January 21, 2005\r\n *   Bug in 'name' function, fix thanks to Bill Edney.\r\n *   Fixed incorrect processing of namespace nodes.\r\n *   Fixed NamespaceResolver to resolve 'xml' namespace.\r\n *   Implemented union '|' operator.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 3: January 14, 2005\r\n *   Fixed bug with nodeset comparisons, bug lexing < and >.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 2: October 26, 2004\r\n *   QName node test namespace handling fixed.  Few other bug fixes.\r\n *\r\n * Revision 1: August 13, 2004\r\n *   Bug fixes from William J.
